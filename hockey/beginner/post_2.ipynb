    "# Recap \n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the beginner series, we will build upon the code from <a href=\"https://www.fantasydatapros.com/fantasyfootball/blog/1\">the last post</a>, introducing more layers and moving parts. We will discuss the Python namespace and how Python keeps track of all the objects we have defined in our program. Additionally, we will learn a little bit about libraries and how we can use them to import code into our namespace (although we won't be importing anything just yet) and built-in objects (which we've actually already used). We will also cover user-defined functions and functions in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Built-in objects and the namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in functions are functions (we touched briefly on this last time) that exist naturally in the Python <i>namespace</i>. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/namespaces-and-scope-in-python/\">namespace</a> sounds very arcane, but essentially it is a collection of already defined names for things that we can use in our code. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Namespaces</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked chatGPT to explain the namespace, to which it replied:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Python namespace is a collection of objects (variable, function, class, etc.) that can be accessed by a unique name. It's basically a way for Python to keep track of all the different objects that you have defined in your program, and make sure that each object has a unique name. This helps to prevent confusion and name collisions between different objects in your program.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can import things in to our namespace, as we'll see in later posts, to bring in more items (functions and classes) to write our code. Importing external code will be useful when we start using libraries like pandas, Python's data manipulation library. A library is a bunch of code already written for you so you don't have to reinvent the wheel. When you import those libraries into your code you are then able to use them once you get them into the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are certain objects that already exist without any necessary importing. These are called \"built-in\" objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "One such built-in function here is the `print` function, which we used in the last post. "

    "We touched only briefly on functions last time, but essentially in Python, functions are blocks of code that are defined once and can be used repeatedly throughout a program. Functions allow for efficient and organized code by breaking down tasks into smaller, reusable chunks. They can accept arguments <i>(inputs)</i> and return values <i>(outputs)</i>. Functions can also be used to create modules, which are collections of related functions that can be imported into other Python scripts (as discussed, we'll be exploring some of these modules/libraries in later posts like pandas). Functions are a key part of Python programming and are used to make code more modular, maintainable, and readable.\n",

    "<h1>User-defined Functions</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "User defined functions in Python are functions that are created and defined by the user, rather than being pre-defined in the language itself. Using a hockey example, a user may define a function that calculates the save percentage for a goalie in a given season. This function would take in parameters such as the player's name, the number of saves, and the number of shots on goal. the function would return the save percentage. This user defined function could then be called and used multiple times throughout the program to calculate save percentage for different goalies.\n",
