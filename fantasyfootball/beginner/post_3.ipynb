    "# Recap \n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have covered two-thirds of the absolute basic tools needed to program in python: data types and functions. Check out our last post <a href=\"https://www.fantasydatapros.com/fantasyfootball/blog/beginner/2\">here</a>. In this post, we take a look at conditionals. This will set us up with all of the basics needed to dive into some real, actionable, fantasy football analysis on our next post. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to control the flow of your code. They allow you to make decisions based on certain conditions and to execute different lines of code depending on whether those conditions are met. In this post, we are going to look at the following components of conditional statements: \n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>If/Else Statements</li>\n",
    "<li>Comparison Operators</li> \n",
    "<li>Logical Operators</li>\n",
    "<li>Elif </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>If/Else Statements</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic conditonals make use of logical \"If/Else\" statements and are a powerful part of any programmers tool belt. An if/else block follows the basic format of \"if this statement here on this first line is true, then run the block of code in the indented lines below, if it's not true, then run the block of code in the indented block below else\". \n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (either True or False) depending on the outcome of the comparison. For example, the `>` operator checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, while the `<=` operator checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right. Some common comparison operators include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>> (greater than)</li>\n",
    "<li>< (less than) </li>\n",
    "<li>>= (greater than or equal to)</li> \n",
    "<li>== (equal to)</li>\n",
    "<li><= (less than or equal to)</li>  \n",
    "<li> != (not equal to) </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the \"equal to\" operator consists of TWO equal signs. Rember the \"=\" symbol is used to assign a value to a variable. \n",

The `and` operator requires every part of the conditional statement to be true for the entire conditional statement to evaluate to `True`. The `or` operator requires only one part of the condiitonal statement to be true for the entire statement to evaluate to `True`. The `not` operator is a little weird and  requires the conditional statement (you guessed it) to NOT be true for the conditional statement to evaluate to True.

    "In this example,`if` tells the computer that whatever we write next will be a condition that needs to be met for the code underneath to run. Next, we establish that the receving yards variable is part of that condition by using the `>=` comparison operator. This one stands for \"greater than or equal to\" and gives the computer the condition that `receving_yards` must be greater than or equal to `1000`. If that condition is met, the `:` colon symbol is used to represent the word \"then\" and the code beneath the if statement is run. So, in a sense we are \"teaching\" the computer with this if-statement that any player that has 1,000 receivng yards or more in an NFL season can be considered a top receiver.
