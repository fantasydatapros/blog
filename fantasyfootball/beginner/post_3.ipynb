    "\n",
    "So far we have covered two-thirds of the most basic tools needed to program in Python: data types and functions. Check out our last post <a href=\"https://www.fantasydatapros.com/fantasyfootball/blog/beginner/2\" target=_blank>here if you missed out</a>. In this post, we take a look at conditionals to round out our trio. This will set us up with all of the basics needed to dive into some real bonafide fantasy football analysis on our next post. \n",

    "<h1>Conditionals</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals are a fundamental concept in programming that allow you to control the flow of your code. They give you the power to make decisions based on certain conditions and to execute different lines of code depending on whether those conditions are (or are not) met.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>If/Else Statements</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic conditionals make use of \"If/Else\" statements and are a powerful part of any programmers toolbelt. An if/else block follows the basic format of \"`if` this statement here on this first line is true, then run the block of code in the indented lines below. Or `else` if it's not true, then run the block of code in the indented block below `else`\".\n",

    "In our code, `if` tells the computer that whatever we write next will be a condition that needs to be met for the code underneath it to run. Next, we establish that the `receiving_yards` variable is part of that condition by using the `>=` comparison operator. <i>We will go into more detail on these later.</i> `>=` stands for \"greater than or equal to\" and gives the computer the condition that `receiving_yards` must be greater than or equal to 1,000 in order to continue. If that condition is met, the `:` colon symbol is used to represent the word \"then\" and the code beneath the if statement is run. So, in a sense we are \"teaching\" the computer with this if-statement that any player that has 1,000 receiving yards or more in an NFL season can be considered a top receiver. \n",

    "I threw in a bonus here and used an f-string in our print statement. F-strings allow us to incorporate variables into strings in an efficient way.

    "First, we established a dictionary of three different receivers. The key : value pairs here represent the player names, their receiving yards, and touchdowns for the 2022 season. Next, created a function called `receiver_rater` that takes the name, receiving_yards, and touchdowns as arguments and prints the appropriate statement based on our written conditional statements. Finally, We use a `for` loop to iterate through our `dict` (for player in players) and apply the function to each player in the dictionary. Let's take a closer look at the conditional statement within our function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Logical Operators</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this conditional we introduce two new concepts. The first is logical operators. These operators are used to combine multiple conditions in a single statement. The most commonly used logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`. In the first line of our conditional we use the `and` operator to combine the receiving yard and touchdown conditions. So, if a player has more than 1,000 receiving yards <b>AND</b> greater than or equal to 7 touchdowns, then that player is a top receiver and the print function below runs using that players name in the print statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Elif</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of our conditional statement uses `elif` which stands for \"else if\" and is a way for us to add more conditions to our conditional statements. Basically, if the first condition is not met the statement following `elif` will be checked and if that is met, the code below the `elif` is run. Our second condition is \"if receiving yards are greater than or equal to 800 OR touchdowns are greater than 4 then run the code below\". Here, the `or` logical operator is used and is less \"strict\" than the `and` operator. In this case, only one of the two conditions in our `elif` statement need to be met for the second print function to run. If we wanted to be more strict in our definition of an above average wide receiver we could certainly use an `and` operator here instead of the `or` operator. Note, you can use as many `elif` statements as you want to establish as many different conditions as you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote><b>Bonus:</b> I challenge you to add another elif statement that defines the conditions that would constitute an \"average\" receiver.</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we again use our `else` statement to catch all other remaining scenarios when the `if` and `elif` conditions are not met. For this simplified example, if you are not a top receiver or an above average receiver, then you are simply \"not a top receiver\". I'd feel bad for Kenny here but he made 21 million dollars to chill on the sidelines this year. So good for him, I guess."

    "<h1>Comparison Operators</h1>\n",
    "Before we finish, I want to take the time to go through comparison operators in a little more depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (either True or False) depending on the outcome of the comparison. For example, the `>` operator checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, while the `<=` operator checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right. A common way to remember these comparison operators is to imagine the > as a hungry alligator who always eats the larger value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other common comparison operators include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> > (greater than)</li>\n",
    "<li> < (less than) </li>\n",
    "<li> >= (greater than or equal to)</li> \n",

    "<li> <= (less than or equal to)</li>  \n",
    "<li> != (not equal to) </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the \"equal to\" operator consists of TWO equal signs. Remember the \"=\" symbol is used to assign a value to a variable. "
