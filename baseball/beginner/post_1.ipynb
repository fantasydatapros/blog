    "A lot of you may know the original series I wrote back in 2020 for <a href=\"https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com\">Fantasy Football Data Pros</a>, which was quite popular amongst Reddit, and hasn't been updated in a while. We've been spending the last couple months at Fantasy Data Pros creating this new platform that caters to every sport, so there hasn't been a ton of time to deliver new content, which has kind of sucked. Thankfully though, we've also spent some time working on the internal code base of our site to make writing blog posts super easy for us, so now that we're back up we could be delivering content at a faster rate than ever. \n",

    "<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FbxyBmmVQAEGy39.jpg\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial series, at least starting out, is meant for complete beginners. We will eventually work our way to bigger and better things like working with Pandas (a Python library) and doing some machine learning, but we're going to start out this post with the very basics of Python before jumping in to the deep end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of this series, and all of our content, is to introduce coding to sports fans in a non-intimidating and easy-to-digest manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, all of our content is focused around project-based learning. I know first hand that project-based learning is the best way to learn to code.\n",

    "When we're writing code, we need to have an environment to do so. You can't just open a word processor and start banging out lines of code. There needs to be an intermediary software that we use that will help us interact with something that will either \"interpret\" our code or compile it down to 1's and 0's (Python uses the \"interpretation\" approach rather than the compilation approach). The topic of interpreation vs. compilation is for another day - what you need to know right now is we need a place to write our code.\n",

    "There's numerous setups out there we can use. A very popular enviornment we can use is a notebook-based environment such as Jupyter or Google Colab. These environments are (a) very easy for beginners to learn starting out (as opposed to IDEs and even text editors which, in almost all cases, will require you downloading software and making some changes to your computer) and (b) are well-suited for data science projects, as they allow us to interate on datasets very quickly. Text editors are okay for beginners, and they vary on a wide range of complexity for the user to interact with, but we want to keep things even simpler by not even downloading any software. (IDEs, ie. Integrate Development Environments are like text editors, but they come with a lot more packed on. They aren't what I'd recommend for beginners, as they can be complex to work with and they hold your hand through a lot of the learning process).\n",

    "There's a certain notebook environment that's completely browser-based and wouldn't require any downloads or nasty configuration with your computers. It's called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Google Colab</a>.\n",
    "\n",

Google is infamous for pulling the rug out from under users in relation to it's products, but for now, we'll stick with Colab. When that day comes it'll be very stressful for me to update all of the content, but hopefully by then you'll be skilled enough to handle other environments :). "

    "\n",
    "<h1>Lists</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is pretty much what it sounds like – a list of Python “objects”. Lists are enclosed by square brackets on both sides. Python objects that go inside lists can either be integers, floats (don’t worry about this for now), dictionaries, strings (a sentence or bunch of ASCII characters enclosed by double or single quotes), lists themselves (you can have a list of lists), and a lot more. Lists can basically hold any Python object, and also, importantly, the <i>type</i> of those objects does not need to be the same. For example, you can have a list which contains strings, integers, and lists that contain, strings, integers, lists, and so on. You get the point. Each of these items is separated by a comma. Again, if you don’t put square brackets or commas in their right place, you get a `SyntaxError`.\n",

    "Here, for each player, we pull out the name value by using `player[‘name’]` to get our player name. This is the syntax we use to pull values from a dictionary. I’ve alluded to the concept of syntax throughout this post by mentioning `SyntaxError`. Syntax is essentially a language’s requirements for how to do a certain task or write a certain line of code. Good convention, which we'll talk about in future posts, isn't necessarily syntax. The syntax to pull a value from a Python dictionary is `dictionary_name[‘key_name’]`.\n",

We can multiply integers together, divide them, and do all sort of basic arithmetic stuff in Python.\n",

    "Then, in the final line of our for loop, we use something called a function (twice). Python has a number of “built-in” functions, meaning functions we can use that Python just provides for us.

There’s one built-in function called `print`, which takes in a Python object and outputs it back to us below. That’s literally all it does. We’ll be using the print function to tell Python to output each player’s score rate in a human-readable way.\n",

The only thing is, that all the objects you are concatenating (that’s the official word for it) must all be strings. This is where the `str` function becomes handy. Our score rate is a number (A float, to be specific, but don’t worry about that), but if we want to output a string and concatenate them together, all the objects we are concatenating need to be strings.
