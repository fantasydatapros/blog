    "# Introductions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first post, in hopefully a series of many posts, on how to use Python to analyze College Football data. Some of you may know me from my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/posts\">Learn Python with Fantasy Football series</a> I wrote on my old website Fantasy Football Data Pros (which is still up, but I'm in the process of moving all of the content over to this new site). If you're wondering why you're reading about CFB on a site with the name \"fantasy\" in it, we're working on the name still while in this transitional period.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been writing programming tutorials for about 3 years now. I've learned that when writing tutorials it's important to define who your audience is beforehand and what their skill level is. This post is not targeted at complete beginners at the moment, but eventually, I will write some more basic Python tutorials for people who are just starting out. This post is better suited for those who have some coding experience, maybe some Python experience, but not much experience with either (a) Python's data science capabilities, (b) data science in general, or (c) the current tools and methods ready and available for analyzing CFB data. It's hard to tell, but I think some of you more tech savvy folks who don't know how to code still might be able to (at least) follow along with these posts until I come out with some more beginner-oriented ones covering basic Python principles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway - I think this series may be fun. Truth be told, I'm historically more of an NFL fan than I am a College Football fan, although that's quickly changing since I graduated from college about a year ago. I know my FSU Seminoles pretty well (if you're a Florida or Miami fan, this is <i>probably</i> not the series for you (jk)), I'm familiar with all of the teams in contention for big bowl games and the playoffs, and most of the top players in the country, but to be honest, I could use some work on my CFB knowledge. In the NFL, I can name you pretty much entire starting rosters, but can't say the same for CFB. I'm still learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, that's quickly changing and I find myself more and more interested in CFB, to the point where I'm more likely to miss a Dolphins game than I am to miss a Florida State game.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm doing this series with the intention of (a) feeding my growing interest in CFB, (b) exploring the current analytics landscape for CFB and maybe even do some work to expand it (my initial research tells me that the resources and content aren't as developed as the NFL space, at least on the interenet), and (c) to get more people into coding and data science by exposing it through college football.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime I'm exploring a new domain for data science purposes, the first thing I'm looking for is data. Free and available data. If it isn't available, it might not be worth digging into the domain until I'm able to figure out a way to access the data or collect it myself. Thankfully, I've found a couple of resources. There's a Reddit thread below which lists out many of the resources available in the CFB space: \n",
    "\n",
    "<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBAnalysis/comments/p3p22c/cfb_data_and_resources_2021_edition/\">Link here</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "There's really one data source that is putting the entire team on it's back, and it's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://collegefootballdata.com/\">CollegeFootballData.com</a>. There's an API, it's free, and it has a Python package. The only drawback, is that the API doesn't integrate amazingly with pandas, which I may end up making some pull requests to help out in that regard. Checks most of the boxes anyway. I would encourage you to investigate it further and check out their <a href=\"https://api.collegefootballdata.com/api/docs/?url=/api-docs.json\">API documentation after this post.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/CFBD/cfbd-python\">Python package</a> for interacting with the API is called `cfbd`. Before actually using it, you'll have to get your API keys by providing your email. They'll then email you an API token.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, data science code, especially in the EDA stage of the process, is typically written in an IPython / notebook environment. Stephen Wolfram describes that the main idea behind noteboks is to <i>\"have an interactive document that freely mixes code, results, graphics, text and everything else\".</i> These environments are perfectly suited for exploratory data analysis as they allow us to iterate easily upon data, and they also help us tell stories with data (as we are going to do throughout this series).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's two main options for notebook environments: either Jupyter Notebooks or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\">Google Colab</a>. Both are browser-based technically, but Jupyter requires some installation. I'd suggest using Google Colab because it is fully remote and requires 0 installation. I really don't want to spend too much time answering people's questions regarding an error with their installation that most of the time ends up being completely unique to their operating system / hardware. You using Google Colab is easy for you (all you need to do is login with a Google account) and easy for me (I don't have to walk you through any installation, not even installing Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "In these notebook environments, you'll have a mix of markdown and also executable IPython cells which can be ran using the play button on the left hand side or using the keystroke combo `Shift Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first logged in, there should have also been a sample notebook and tutorial detailing some more features regarding Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's write some code!\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new notebook, and in the first cells let's install and import `cfbd` and start messing around and seeing what data we can find. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we are going to examine one of the many datasets we can pull from this API, manipulate it a bit, and put together a quick visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we install `cfbd` and `flatdict` for use in our Colab environment using pip. You'll need to do this for every new notebook you create. If you haven't already, navigate over to CollegeFootballData.com and generate your API key. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second block below, your code is going to look slightly different than mine (while I've advised you guys use Colab I'm personally using Jupyter Notebook since I have to push this notebook to Git). I'm saving my environment variables in a file called `.env` and loading them with a Python package called `python-dotenv` that exposes them to whatever environment I'm doing this in. That's just to keep my API key protected since CFBD asked me to. You can just paste in your API key and directly assign it to `CFDB_API_KEY`."

You can think of the figure as the entire visualization, and the axes we create are the individual plots. We use the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html\">function</a> `plt.subplots` to do this. When we call that function we can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://stackabuse.com/unpacking-in-python-beyond-parallel-assignment/\">unpack</a> the axes objects, based on the arguments we provide (first arg is number of rows, second arg is number of columns). We can set the size of the entire visualization by passing in a tuple to the `figsize` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have all our axes ready, we can call the `Axes.bar` function on all of them to create individual bar plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "I encourage you to check out the documentation I linked for details into the arguments of both `plt.subplots` and `Axes.bar` and such. Really for `bar`, we just pass in our `x` labels, and the heights, which is the mean output for each teams explosiveness category. The rest is styling. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://teamcolorcodes.com/\">I pulled the team color hex codes for you using this website.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also call another function called `set_ylim` to adjust the axes scaling on the y-axis. I've added some comments below further explaining the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, if this is going over your head, we are going to be covering visualizations in a lot more depth in future posts."
